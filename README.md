Amrita Winners is a browser-based endless runner game inspired by Temple Run, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game is set in a real Indian school campus environment, blending real-world imagery with 2D game mechanics to create a unique and personal gameplay experience.

Players control Shakti, a schoolboy who must run, jump across platforms, and escape from an enemy while covering maximum distance. The game focuses on smooth movement, distance tracking, and mobile-friendly controls, and runs entirely in the browser without any installation.
